Dvorak2Qwerty
=============

One of my friend uses Dvorak keyboard.

Every time I use his computer, I can't do anything because I can't type.

So yesterday I decided to make a little tool to solve this problem.

The solution is really simple,
just build a key mapping,
trap the key and do translate;
how to design the user interface is more harder,
I don't want to make this tool "colorful" or "cool" so it has just gray background.

This webpage provides two direction of translation and two keyboard snapshot.
